For each slice:

1. Create reducers folder
2. Create extraReducers foolder
3. For each slice reducer create a file in the reducers folder named "<reducerName>_Reducer.ts" and move the reducer to that file
4. For each extra reducer create a file called "<endpointName>_<type>_Builder.ts" and move the extra reducer to that file 
    - type could be matchFulfilled, matchPending, matchRejected
    
    example:
        const newProject_MatchFulfilled_ER = (builder: ActionReducerMapBuilder<UIProjectSlice>) => {
            builder.addMatcher(appApi.endpoints.newProject.matchFulfilled, (state, { payload: project }) =>
                ...
            );
        };
